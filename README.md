# To-Do
# QA Engineering Portfolio Project: Simple To-Do App

This project is a hands-on demonstration of core Quality Assurance engineering skills. It consists of a simple, functional To-Do web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, accompanied by complete QA documentation.

The primary goal is to showcase my ability to:
*   Design comprehensive test cases (happy path, edge cases, negative testing).
*   Identify, isolate, and report bugs with clear steps and severity levels.
*   Understand the bug life cycle from discovery to fix verification and regression testing.
*   Create clear technical documentation for both end-users and development teams.

While the application itself is simple, the focus is on the rigorous QA processes applied to it.
