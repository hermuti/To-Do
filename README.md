# QA Engineering Portfolio Project: Simple To-Do App

A hands-on demonstration of comprehensive Quality Assurance processes applied to a functional web application. This project showcases my ability to design test cases, report bugs, and document the complete QA lifecycle.

The primary goal is to showcase my ability to:
*   Design comprehensive test cases (happy path, edge cases, negative testing).
*   Identify, isolate, and report bugs with clear steps and severity levels.
*   Understand the bug life cycle from discovery to fix verification and regression testing.
*   Create clear technical documentation for both end-users and development teams.

While the application itself is simple, the focus is on the rigorous QA processes applied to it.




## QA Documentation

This project includes complete QA documentation demonstrating testing methodologies:

- Test Cases: [test_cases.md](test_cases.md) - 13 functional test cases covering:
  - Happy path scenarios (adding, completing, deleting tasks)
  - Edge cases (empty inputs, special characters, rapid input)
  - Negative testing (error handling, validation)
  - UI/UX testing (layout, responsiveness)

- Bug Reports: [bug_reports.md](bug_reports.md) - 5 documented bugs featuring:
  - Detailed reproduction steps
  - Root cause analysis
  - Fix documentation
  - Retest verification results
  - Priority/severity assessment
- Test Coverage: Includes validation testing, functional testing, UI testing, and regression testing

## 🚀 Features

- Add Tasks: Quick task entry with input validation
- Mark Complete: Visual completion indicator with line-through styling
- Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks with delete buttons
- Clear Completed: Bulk remove finished tasks
- Task Counter: Real-time count of active tasks
- Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 📋 Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- No additional dependencies or installation required

## 🔍 QA Process Demonstrated

1. Test Planning: Creation of comprehensive test cases
2. Test Execution: Manual testing of all functionality
3. Bug Reporting: Detailed documentation of issues found
4. Root Cause Analysis: Investigation of underlying issues
5. Fix Verification: Validation of corrections
6. Regression Testing: Ensuring fixes don't break existing functionality

## 🛠 Technologies & Practices

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- Version Control: Git with semantic commit messages
- Documentation: Markdown for README, test cases, and bug reports
- QA Methodologies: 
  - Functional testing
  - Regression testing
  - Usability testing
  - Negative testing
  - Edge case testing
